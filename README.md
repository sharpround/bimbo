## setup
### utils
* functions to encode/decode categorical
* make features

### dev
* make small dev set
1. load data
2. encode labels
    * save



## todo
next steps

* make smaller development data set
* metric
* transform/predict test data and make submission

improvements:

* add historical data
* add embeddings for categorical variables
* clean up the client names by finding and merging any that are actually the same client under different names
* split out the weight and the suffix codes from the products

## done
* encode labels (for memory)
* naive neural net
* mean square log error metric


## results
